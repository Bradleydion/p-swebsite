        the skills, knowledge and commitment to do the job right; from project
        conception to providing care long after the project is complete. Palmer

        metal, fabrication of piping and sheet metal systems, mechanical design

        in 2017 celebrated their 15th anniversary as an ESOP. The company was
        founded in 1954 by Bud Palmer and Leon Sicard. Since then, we have grown
        from a two-person organization into one of the largest full-service
        mechanical contracting firms in New England. For more than half a
        century, we haven’t only been building excellent mechanical
        systems—we’ve been building relationships of trust with our clients.
        Trust earned through our commitment to quality workmanship and
        dependable customer service. It’s the reason more than 90% of Palmer and
        Sicard’s business comes from referrals and repeat clients. And because
        we are an employee-owned business, that commitment to quality is shared
        by every employee. Palmer and Sicard is headquartered in Exeter, NH,
        where our 18,000 square foot design and manufacturing facility is
        located. As a full-service Mechanical Contractor, Palmer and Sicard can
        handle all of the plumbing and pipefitting, sheet metal, HVAC, design,
        and service needs for your facility. Our diverse portfolio of completed
        projects includes office buildings, hospitals, schools and universities,
        manufacturing plants, and retail stores to name a few.
